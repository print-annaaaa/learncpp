# learncpp learnign journey

## Introduction 
üëãüèæ I'm Anna and this is the record of my progress through [learncpp][def]. 
I decided to learn C++ in-depth after using it during an internship and learning more about how important it could be for systems that require high speed and efficiency.
What do I hope comes out of this? Well, for one a robust understanding of C++ basics and eagerness to lear more and build my own projects.
